# Grafana Dashboard Setup for Azure Monitor

## Overview
This document outlines the step-by-step process of setting up Grafana to monitor Azure virtual machines using Azure Monitor.

## SSH into VM after Ubuntu 
Grafana is accessible at:
```
http://130.107.138.0:3000
```

## Steps to Set Up

### 1. Install Grafana
Grafana was installed on the VM using:
```sh
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y grafana
```
Then, it was started and enabled on boot:
```sh
sudo systemctl start grafana-server
sudo systemctl enable grafana-server
```

### 2. Configure Azure Monitor as a Data Source
1. Logged into Grafana at `http://130.107.138.0:3000`
2. Navigated to **Configuration > Data Sources**
3. Selected **Azure Monitor** and configured it with:
   - **Client ID**: `<your-client-id>`
   - **Client Secret**: `<your-client-secret>`
   - **Tenant ID**: `<your-tenant-id>`
   - **Subscription ID**: `<your-subscription-id>`
4. Clicked **Save & Test** to verify the connection

### 3. Created a New Dashboard
1. Navigated to **Dashboards > New Dashboard**
2. Added a new panel and selected **grafana-azure-monitor-datasource**
3. Set up queries for:
   - **Percentage CPU**
   - **Available Memory Percentage (Preview)**
   - **Network Out Total**
4. Configured **time range** to `Last 3 hours`
5. Set **time grain** to `1 hour` (adjustable per query)
6. Clicked **Apply** to save changes

### 4. Troubleshooting Errors
- **400 Bad Request (Time Range Issue)**
  - Error: `End time must be at least 1 minute later than start time`
  - Fixed by ensuring **time range and time grain are properly configured**

- **Data Not Appearing**
  - Verified **Azure Monitor Metrics exist for the VM**
  - Checked that the VM's **diagnostic settings were properly configured**

### 5. Securing Grafana
- Grafana was configured to allow secure login:
```sh
sudo nano /etc/grafana/grafana.ini
```
- Updated the following settings:
```ini
[security]
default_admin_password = <your-secure-password>
```
- Restarted Grafana to apply changes:
```sh
sudo systemctl restart grafana-server
```

## Conclusion
Grafana is now successfully set up to monitor Azure VM metrics. The dashboard provides insights into CPU usage, memory, and network activity. If any issues arise, refer to the **Troubleshooting Errors** section.
